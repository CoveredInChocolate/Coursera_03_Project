# Codebook


This codebook is for the **Coursera - Data Science - 03 Getting and Cleaning Data** Project.
=======
A list of all columns in the final tables. Description of the data:

	These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
	'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

	tBodyAcc-XYZ
	tGravityAcc-XYZ
	tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
	tBodyGyro-XYZ
	tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
	tBodyAccMag
	tGravityAccMag
	tBodyAccJerkMag
	tBodyGyroMag
	tBodyGyroJerkMag
	fBodyAcc-XYZ
	fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
	fBodyGyro-XYZ
	fBodyAccMag
	fBodyAccJerkMag
	fBodyGyroMag
	fBodyGyroJerkMag

	The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

	mean(): Mean value
	std(): Standard deviation

	Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

	gravityMean
	tBodyAccMean
	tBodyAccJerkMean
	tBodyGyroMean
	tBodyGyroJerkMean
